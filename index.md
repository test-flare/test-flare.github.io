The cost of software failures is a huge burden to the worldwide economy. Consequently, software testing contributes to a large proportion of software development effort and cost. *Flaky tests* are a particular strain on software development because they intermittently pass and fail without changes to tests or project code with often non-obvious causes. When flaky tests proliferate, developers may loose faith in their test suites, potentially exposing end-users to the consequences of software failures. Flaky tests are a common occurrence in industry, even for companies with the greatest amount of resources to tackle them.

The Test FLARE project will develop and empirically evaluate techniques capable of automatically reproducing flaky behaviour that is due to the execution
environment. It will also provide developers with automated, human-readable explanations that help them further understand the reasons for the flaky behaviour.
