The cost of software failures is a huge burden to the worldwide economy. Consequently, software testing contributes to a large proportion of software development effort and cost. *Flaky tests* are a particular strain on software testing because they intermittently pass and fail without changes to tests or project code with often non-obvious causes. When flaky tests proliferate, developers may loose faith in their test suites, potentially exposing end-users to the consequences of software failures. Flaky tests are a common occurrence in industry, even for large companies with considerable resources to tackle them. Test FLARE is an EPSRC-funded project will develop and empirically evaluate techniques capable of automatically reproducing flaky behaviour. It will also provide developers with automated, human-readable explanations that help them further understand the reasons for the flaky behaviour.
